# AMBERMAP: Mapping the Future of Safety
# "Mapping the future of safety, one child at a time."

AMBERMAP is an open-source AMBER Alert mapping program designed to analyze and identify patterns in child abduction cases. By leveraging AI-driven automation, demographic analysis, and historical backtracing, AMBERMAP provides insights into high-risk areas and potential correlations between cases.

## üîç Key Features
- **üìä Automated Data Collection** ‚Äì Aggregates publicly available data on demographics, businesses, organizations, and locations linked to reported abductions.
- **üß† AI-Driven Pattern Recognition** ‚Äì Identifies trends, correlations, and risk factors using historical data and predictive modeling.
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Mapping** ‚Äì Visualizes abduction hotspots, demographic trends, and sector connections in an intuitive web-based interface.
- **üîÑ Backtracing & Accuracy Refinement** ‚Äì Tests AI algorithms against historical data to enhance predictive capabilities.
- **üì¢ Social Media Automation** ‚Äì Generates and publishes reports on identified high-risk areas when predictive accuracy reaches a set threshold.
- **üìå Demographic & Environmental Analysis** ‚Äì Incorporates data from religious organizations, businesses, traffic volumes, and vehicle registrations to build comprehensive case profiles.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Enhance Law Enforcement Intelligence** ‚Äì Provide AI-generated reports to assist investigative teams.
- **Develop an Open-Source Research Database** ‚Äì Store and analyze child abduction data for research and predictive modeling.
- **Enable Correlation Analysis** ‚Äì Identify links between reported cases and external socio-economic factors.
- **Increase Public Awareness** ‚Äì Use automated mapping and social media alerts to inform communities.

## üöÄ Future Development Plans
- **AI-Driven Psychological Profiling** ‚Äì Develop behavioral profiles of known offenders to predict potential future cases.
- **Enhanced Data Sources** ‚Äì Integrate additional datasets, including hotel/motel registries, traffic camera analysis, and business activity tracking.
- **Privacy & Compliance** ‚Äì Maintain strict adherence to ethical guidelines, focusing only on publicly available data.

# DEVELOPMENT PLAN

# 1: Identify Data Sources:
‚Ä¢	AMBER Alert cases (e.g., public law enforcement sites).
‚Ä¢	Census data (U.S. Census Bureau API).
‚Ä¢	Religious/non-profit organizations (IRS 990 forms, Charity Navigator).
‚Ä¢	Crime rates (FBI crime API).
‚Ä¢	News articles (Google News or aggregators).
# 2: Set Up Development Environment:
‚Ä¢	Install Python (latest version).
‚Ä¢	Set up libraries: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, GeoPandas, Folium.
‚Ä¢	Choose IDE (VSCode, PyCharm).
# 3: Data Scraping Framework:
‚Ä¢	Build Scrapy spiders for government and public sites.
‚Ä¢	Use BeautifulSoup for static page parsing.
‚Ä¢	Document APIs for automated requests.
# 4: Data Collection Pipeline:
‚Ä¢	Automate data fetching with a cron job or equivalent scheduler.
‚Ä¢	Store raw data in JSON/CSV formats initially for validation.
# 5:  Database Design:
‚Ä¢	Set up PostgreSQL (preferred for structured data).
‚Ä¢	Design tables for demographics, incidents, organizations, and locations.
# 6: Data Cleaning:
‚Ä¢	Use Pandas for merging, deduplication, and filling missing values.
‚Ä¢	Validate data against expected formats (e.g., coordinates, names).
# 7: Geographic Mapping Setup:
‚Ä¢	Integrate OpenStreetMap or Google Maps APIs.
‚Ä¢	Build GeoJSON files for plotting demographic and incident data.
# 8: Pattern Analysis:
‚Ä¢	Develop Python scripts to identify correlations (e.g., age, ethnicity, location).
‚Ä¢	Test initial hypotheses with small datasets.
# 9:  Predictive Model Development:
‚Ä¢	Use scikit-learn to create models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests).
‚Ä¢	Test for probabilities of incidents in specific areas.
# 10:  Model Training and Validation:
‚Ä¢	Split data into training and test sets.
‚Ä¢	Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall.
# 11:  Visualization Framework:
‚Ä¢	Set up Folium for interactive maps.
‚Ä¢	Use Plotly for trend analysis and dashboard integration.
# 12:  Web Interface Setup:
‚Ä¢	Use Flask/Django to serve data and visualizations.
‚Ä¢	Host locally or on a cloud platform.
# 13:  Automated Updates:
‚Ä¢	Build scripts to refresh datasets periodically.
‚Ä¢	Log success/failure of updates.
# 14: Documentation:
‚Ä¢	Document all APIs, scripts, and data schemas.
‚Ä¢	Provide clear instructions for contributors.
# 15: GitHub Repository:
‚Ä¢	Create a structured repo with folders for scripts, datasets, models, and visuals.
‚Ä¢	Add a detailed README.md with setup instructions.
# 16:  Initial Testing:
‚Ä¢	Run the full pipeline with sample data.
‚Ä¢	Fix bugs in scraping, storage, or processing.
# 17:  Community Contributions:
‚Ä¢	Open the project to contributors with issue tracking.
