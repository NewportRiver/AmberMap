# AmberMap
"Mapping the future of safety, one child at a time."

# PROJECT GOAL
The goal is to enhance public safety awareness and reduce abduction risks through open-source data sharing and collaboration.
By utilizing publicly accessible data and AI-assisted predictive models we analyze AMBER Alerts, identify specific demographics and highlight geographic locations at higher risk for child abduction.

# DEVELOPMENT PLAN

#1: Identify Data Sources:
•	AMBER Alert cases (e.g., public law enforcement sites).
•	Census data (U.S. Census Bureau API).
•	Religious/non-profit organizations (IRS 990 forms, Charity Navigator).
•	Crime rates (FBI crime API).
•	News articles (Google News or aggregators).
#2: Set Up Development Environment:
•	Install Python (latest version).
•	Set up libraries: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, GeoPandas, Folium.
•	Choose IDE (VSCode, PyCharm).
#3: Data Scraping Framework:
•	Build Scrapy spiders for government and public sites.
•	Use BeautifulSoup for static page parsing.
•	Document APIs for automated requests.
#4: Data Collection Pipeline:
•	Automate data fetching with a cron job or equivalent scheduler.
•	Store raw data in JSON/CSV formats initially for validation.
#5:  Database Design:
•	Set up PostgreSQL (preferred for structured data).
•	Design tables for demographics, incidents, organizations, and locations.
#6: Data Cleaning:
•	Use Pandas for merging, deduplication, and filling missing values.
•	Validate data against expected formats (e.g., coordinates, names).
#7: Geographic Mapping Setup:
•	Integrate OpenStreetMap or Google Maps APIs.
•	Build GeoJSON files for plotting demographic and incident data.
#8: Pattern Analysis:
•	Develop Python scripts to identify correlations (e.g., age, ethnicity, location).
•	Test initial hypotheses with small datasets.
#9:  Predictive Model Development:
•	Use scikit-learn to create models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests).
•	Test for probabilities of incidents in specific areas.
#10:  Model Training and Validation:
•	Split data into training and test sets.
•	Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall.
#11:  Visualization Framework:
•	Set up Folium for interactive maps.
•	Use Plotly for trend analysis and dashboard integration.
#12:  Web Interface Setup:
•	Use Flask/Django to serve data and visualizations.
•	Host locally or on a cloud platform.
#13:  Automated Updates:
•	Build scripts to refresh datasets periodically.
•	Log success/failure of updates.
#14: Documentation:
•	Document all APIs, scripts, and data schemas.
•	Provide clear instructions for contributors.
#15: GitHub Repository:
•	Create a structured repo with folders for scripts, datasets, models, and visuals.
•	Add a detailed README.md with setup instructions.
#16:  Initial Testing:
•	Run the full pipeline with sample data.
•	Fix bugs in scraping, storage, or processing.
#17:  Community Contributions:
•	Open the project to contributors with issue tracking.
•	Add guidelines for data privacy and ethics.
#18:  Scalability Planning:
•	Plan migration to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud AI).
•	Optimize scripts for performance with large datasets.
#19:  Launch MVP:
•	Focus on one state with high AMBER Alerts.
•	Publish on GitHub and collect feedback for improvements.
