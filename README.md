# AmberMap
"Mapping the future of safety, one child at a time."

PROJECT GOAL
The goal is to enhance public safety awareness and reduce abduction risks through open-source data sharing and collaboration.
By utilizing publicly accessible data and AI-assisted predictive models we analyze AMBER Alerts, identify specific demographics and highlight geographic locations at higher risk for child abduction.
